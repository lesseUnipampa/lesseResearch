##  Laboratory of Empirical Studies in Software Engineering (LESSE) 

**Created in 2018, the Laboratory of Empirical Studies in Software Engineering (LESSE) of UNIPAMPA has as main objective to support the teaching, research and dissemination of knowledge in the area of Software Engineering in Empirical Studies.**

**Our researches are available at:**

## PAxSPL 
The Prepare, Assemble and Execute (PAEPSPL) is a process that assembles and executes a feature retrieval process for 
SPL re-engineering. Access at [PAxSPL](https://github.com/HestiaProject/PAxSPL).

## PleTs
Product Line of Testing Tools (PLeTs) is a product line of testing tools. A software product line is a family of software products 
that have a common core. PLeTs provide a set of testing tools that aid in the automation of software testing. 
Access at [PleTs](https://github.com/GiliSchmidt/PleTs-Testing).

## SonarQubeRules
Access at [SonarQubeRules](https://github.com/yuryalencar/SonarQubeRules).

## Canopus
Canopus is a domain-specific language (DSL) for modeling performance testing. Access at [Canopus](https://github.com/ProjetoDSL/Canopus).

## PMST 

A Project Managament Software Tool created to give support to Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). Access at [PMST](https://github.com/ProjetoPM/PMST)

## WebAtlas

The WebAtlas projecte intends to create a web-based platafomr for teaching of SPL concepts through the use of a feature diagram modeling tool. Access at [WebAtlas](https://github.com/lucascorrea122/Atlas/).

## Thoth 

The Thoth tool main objective is to give support to systematic mapping studies and systematic literature reviews. Thoth repository can be accessed at [Thoth](https://github.com/ProjetoESE/Thoth).

## StringImprover

The StringImprover app is used for automatic improving search strings for systematic literature reviews. The repository can be accessed at [StringImprover](https://github.com/Hateki/stringImprover).
